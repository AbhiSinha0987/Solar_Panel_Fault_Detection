# Solar panel defect classification model using Convolutional Neural Network-Deep Learning

Building a convolutional neural network that will be trained on images of faulty and normal solar panels, and later be able to predict if the given image is either of a fault or nofault.

Using Keras deep learning library in python to build CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)

Building Model:

The process of building a Convolutional Neural Network always involves four major steps.

Step - 1 : Convolution
Step - 2 : Pooling
Step - 3 : Flattening
Step - 4 : Full connection
